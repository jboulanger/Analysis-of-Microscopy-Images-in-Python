    "## Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of module and packages is to be able to reuse code. Packages can be loaded\n",
    "to perform various task such as loading data, making figure, processing images, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A python **scripts** ends in .py and will be interpreter by the python runtime,\n",
    "  you can execute the script as `python -m myscript.py` in a command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "A python **module** is a set of python .py files in a folder that can be reused\n",
    "by other pieces of code or scripts. The module is also associated to a namespace\n",
    "which allows to isolate reference to the functions of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "A python **package** is a folder containing a set of one of several modules and\n",
    "that usually contains a `__init__.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the code of a package by importing it into the our code using import\n",
    "statement. For example, to import math functions, we type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function in math will be accessible in the math namespace as\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = math.log(2.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can also import parts of the module, using the syntax `from xxx import yyy`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from math import log\n",
    "```\n",
    "and use directly the imported code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = log(2.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages can be shared by publishing them on a package repository such as pyPI, a conda channel, on github or as a standalone folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Python Wheel** is a zip archive containing a built distribution of the \n",
    "package specific to the python version and plateform (Wind/Mac OS..).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install packages, we can use either `pip` or `conda` as **package manager**:\n",
    "### pip \n",
    "Pip is a package manager for Python. It can install packaged from pyPI for \n",
    "example using `pip install package`. Is it usually installed with python.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Advanced] learn how to make a package [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### conda\n",
    "Conda is a package and environment (see next section) manager not limited to\n",
    "python. You need to install a version of conda first [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation). We suggest installing miniconda which are a \n",
    "much smaller footprint (~70MB) than the anaconda distribution (600MB). Installing packages is similar to pip:\n",
    "`conda install package`. Several channels exists and provide different list of\n",
    "package. Use for example `conda install package -c conda-forge` to install a package\n",
    "from the conda-forge channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that conda and pip and be mixed for installing packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find \n",

    "\n",
    "## Environments\n",
    "Some code might require various version of the same packages or not the same \n",
    "set of packages. You may also want to be able to reproduce the same behaviour\n",
    "on another computer. For this **environments** help isolate the python installation\n",
    "and packages from the rest of the system. They are essentially a folder with\n",
    "a copy of the python binary and the path to all the installed packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create environment we can use the `venv`  python module or the `conda`  \n",
    " environment manager.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### venv\n",
    " Create a virtual environment `myenv`, by specifying the path to the folder that \n",
    " will contain the python binary and packages:  \n",
    " ```\n",
    " python -m venv /path/to/myenv\n",
    " ```\n",
    "To activate this environment we type on Unix (bash shell):\n",
    "```\n",
    "source /path/to/myenv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "and on Windows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "path\\to\\myenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### conda\n",
    "Conda is another environment manager. Here environments are stored in a default\n",
    "location and pre-compiled binaries can be installed on various plateform which\n",
    "simplified complex packages requiring specific hardware configuration. See the \n",
    "previous section for the installation procedure. To create an environment, we\n",
    "can type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can create an environment from a yml file which describes the list of \n",
    "packages, for example:\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "name: imaging\n",
    "channels:\n",
    "  - conda-forge\n",
    "  - defaults\n",
    "dependencies:\n",
    "  - ipython\n",
    "  - pip\n",
    "  - matplotlib\n",
    "  - pandas\n",
    "  - scikit-image\n",
    "```\n",
    "To create an environment with the listed packages, use:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create --file environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate the environment type:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "We prefer here to use conda to manage environment as it is able to install\n",
    "precompiled binaries which would be hard to install on certain plateform.\n",
    "Again it is possible to install packages using pip in a conda environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebooks\n",
    "A jupyter notebook is essentially a JSON text file which store blocks (cells) of code, \n",
    "text and the result of the running cells. It allows to run the cells one by one and \n",
    "interact with the code. The result of running a cell being possibly a figure, an image, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks run the code using a computational engine called a kernel that can be \n",
    "mapped to a specific virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable use notebooks, we can either use a browser based interface such as \n",
    "Jupyter Lab or a text editor such as Visual Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Lab\n",
    "To install jupyter lab, we can type in a command line:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "conda install jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will install the required dependency as well such as the ipykernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create then a kernel for the environment:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Lab supports a number of useful extensions, install cell tags and spreadsheets\n",
    "using:\n",

    "jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/celltags\n",
    "jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-spreadsheet\n",

    "Download and install visual code from \n",
    "[here](https://github.com/jboulanger/Analysis-of-Microscopy-Images-in-Python/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). We install ipykernel using the following commands:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate myenv\n",
    "conda install ipykernel -c anaconda\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, when restarting Visual Code, the environement `myenv` should be visible as a \n",
